    <h2>Description</h2>
    <img src="images/capirotada.webp">
    <p>This is a traditional Mexican bread pudding served during Lent. It is commonly made with piloncillo (Mexican brown sugar).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>3 cups brown sugar, divided</li>
        <li>2 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>2 cups butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 loaves sliced white bread, toasted</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg, or to taste</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cloves, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups raisins</li>
        <li>2 cups peanuts</li>
        <li>1 pound shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine water, 2 cups brown sugar, and cinnamon sticks together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved and liquid has reduced into a syrup, about 15 minutes. Remove cinnamon sticks from syrup using a slotted spoon.</li>
        <li>Spread butter onto each toasted bread slice. Make 1 layer of buttered bread in a deep casserole dish or oven-proof stockpot. Sprinkle cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves over bread layer. Sprinkle 1/4 the raisins, 1/4 the peanuts, 1/4 the remaining brown sugar, and 1/4 the Cheddar cheese over bread layer. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients. Pour cinnamon syrup over entire dish; cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, about 30 minutes. Cool for 20 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
